# Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns are used to manage relationships and responsibilities between objects. They define ways to compose objects to form larger structures. The following structural design patterns are showcased in this project:

- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

### Project Structure

The project has the following directory structure:

- `Adapter`
- `Bridge`
- `Composite`
- `Decorator`
- `Facade`
- `Flyweight`
- `Proxy`
- `..Examples/`
    - `AdapterExample.php`
    - `BridgeExample.php`
    - `CompositeExample.php`
    - `DecoratorExample.php`
    - `FacadeExample.php`
    - `FlyweightExample.php`
    - `ProxyExample.php`

The `StructuralDesignPatterns/` directory contains the implementation of each design pattern as a separate PHP class. The `..Examples/` directory contains a usage example of each design pattern in a separate PHP file.

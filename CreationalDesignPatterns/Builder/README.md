## Builder Design Pattern

The Builder Design Pattern is a creational pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing you to create different representations of the same object. This pattern involves creating a builder class that defines a set of methods for creating parts of the object, and a director class that uses the builder to construct the final object.

To use the Builder pattern, create a builder class that defines a set of methods for creating parts of the object. Then, create a director class that uses the builder to construct the final object, using the builder's methods to create and assemble the parts.

Builder pattern is particularly useful when you want to create complex objects with multiple parts and provide a flexible way to create different representations of the same object.

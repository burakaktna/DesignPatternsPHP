# Facade Design Pattern

The Facade Design Pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. This pattern involves creating a facade class that provides a single, simplified interface to a set of classes or subsystems.

To use the Facade pattern, create a facade class that exposes a simplified interface to the complex subsystem, and delegate the work to the appropriate classes or subsystems.

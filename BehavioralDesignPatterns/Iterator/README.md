# Iterator Design Pattern

The Iterator Design Pattern is a behavioral pattern that provides a way to access elements of an aggregate object sequentially, without exposing its underlying representation.

To implement the Iterator pattern, create an Iterator interface that defines the hasNext() and next() methods, and a ConcreteIterator class that implements these methods and keeps track of the current position in the aggregate object.

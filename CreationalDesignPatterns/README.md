The project has the following directory structure:

  - `FactoryMethod`
  - `Singleton`

  - `Builder`
  - `Prototype`
- `..Examples/`
  - `SingletonExample.php`
  - `AbstractFactoryExample.php`
  - `BuilderExample.php`
  - `FactoryMethodExample.php`
  - `PrototypeExample.php`

`CreationalDesignPatterns/` contains the implementation of each design pattern as a separate PHP class. `..Examples/` contains a usage example of each design pattern in a separate PHP file.

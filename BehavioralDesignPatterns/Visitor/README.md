# Visitor Design Pattern

The Visitor Design Pattern is a behavioral pattern that separates an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates. The algorithm is defined in a Visitor class, and the object structure is defined in an Element hierarchy.

To use the Visitor pattern, create a Visitor interface that defines a visit() method for each ConcreteElement class, and ConcreteVisitor classes that implement these methods to perform the desired operations on the ConcreteElement objects.

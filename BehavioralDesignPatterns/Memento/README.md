# Memento Design Pattern

The Memento Design Pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows for the capture and externalization of an object's internal state without violating encapsulation. It provides a way to restore an object to its previous state.

To use the Memento pattern, create a Memento class that stores the internal state of the Originator object, an Originator class that creates and stores the Memento objects, and a Caretaker class that manages the Memento objects.

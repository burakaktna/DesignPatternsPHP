# Factory Design Pattern

The Factory Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that deals with object creation. This pattern provides an interface for object creation and delegates the object creation process to subclasses. This makes object creation more flexible and extensible.

To use the Factory pattern, define a set of related objects. Then, create an interface that defines the object creation process. Finally, create concrete classes that implement the interface and provide specific object creation for each object.

Factory design pattern is particularly useful when you need to create multiple objects and want to centralize the object creation process.

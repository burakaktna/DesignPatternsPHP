# Decorator Design Pattern

The Decorator Design Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. This pattern involves creating a decorator class that wraps the original object and adds new functionality to it.

To use the Decorator pattern, create a component interface that defines the common methods for both the original object and the decorator object. Then, create a concrete component class that implements the component interface, and one or more decorator classes that wrap the component object and add new functionality.

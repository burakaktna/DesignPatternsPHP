# PHP Design Patterns Repository

This Git repository contains examples of the three types of design patterns: creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns implemented in PHP.

## Creational Design Patterns

Creational design patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The examples in this repository for Creational Design Patterns include:

- Singleton Pattern
- Factory Pattern
- Abstract Factory Pattern
- Builder Pattern
- Prototype Pattern

## Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns are concerned with object composition and provide class and object composition structures that can be utilized to form large structures. The examples in this repository for Structural Design Patterns include:

- Adapter Pattern
- Bridge Pattern
- Composite Pattern
- Decorator Pattern
- Fa√ßade Pattern
- Flyweight Pattern
- Proxy Pattern

## Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral design patterns are concerned with communication between objects, encapsulating behavior in objects, and delegating requests to appropriate objects. The examples in this repository for Behavioral Design Patterns include:

- Chain of Responsibility Pattern
- Command Pattern
- Interpreter Pattern
- Iterator Pattern
- Mediator Pattern
- Memento Pattern
- Observer Pattern
- State Pattern
- Strategy Pattern
- Template Method Pattern
- Visitor Pattern

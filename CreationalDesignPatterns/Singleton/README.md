# Singleton Design Pattern

The Singleton Design Pattern is a creational pattern that ensures that a class has only one instance while providing a global point of access to it. This pattern involves creating a class with a method that creates an object if it does not exist, or returns the existing instance if it already exists.

To use the Singleton pattern, create a class with a private constructor to prevent direct instantiation of the object. Then, create a static method that creates the object if it does not exist or returns the existing instance if it already exists.

Singleton pattern is particularly useful when you want to restrict the number of instances of a class to exactly one.

# Bridge Design Pattern

The Bridge Design Pattern decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. This pattern involves creating two separate hierarchies, one for the abstraction and one for the implementation, and connecting them using a bridge.

To use the Bridge pattern, create an abstraction class that defines the interface for the abstraction, and an implementation class that defines the interface for the implementation. Then, create a bridge class that connects the two interfaces.

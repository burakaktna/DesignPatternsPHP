# Abstract Factory Design Pattern

The Abstract Factory Design Pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. This pattern is an extension of the Factory pattern and provides an interface for creating multiple factories, each of which can create different types of objects.

To use the Abstract Factory pattern, define a set of related or dependent objects. Then, create an abstract factory interface that defines the methods for creating the objects. Finally, create concrete factory classes that implement the abstract factory interface and provide specific object creation for each object.

Abstract Factory pattern is particularly useful when you need to create families of related or dependent objects and want to provide a common interface for their creation.

# State Design Pattern

The State Design Pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object appears to change its class.

To implement the State pattern, create a State interface that defines a set of methods that encapsulate the behavior of the object in a particular state, and ConcreteState classes that implement these methods.

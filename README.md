# PHP Design Patterns Repository

This Git repository contains examples of the three types of design patterns: creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns implemented in PHP.

- Singleton Pattern
- Factory Pattern
- Abstract Factory Pattern

- Mediator Pattern
- Memento Pattern
- Observer Pattern
- State Pattern

# Strategy Design Pattern

The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows for the definition of a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable. This pattern enables algorithms to vary independently from clients that use it. The Strategy pattern is particularly useful in situations where many related classes only differ in their behavior.

To use the Strategy pattern, first define a set of related algorithms. Then, create an interface that defines the algorithm's behavior. Finally, create concrete classes that implement the interface and provide specific behavior for each algorithm.

## Prototype Design Pattern

The Prototype Design Pattern is a creational pattern that allows you to create new objects by cloning existing ones. This pattern involves creating a prototype interface or abstract class that defines a method for cloning the object, and concrete classes that implement the prototype and provide their own implementation of the cloning method.

To use the Prototype pattern, create a prototype interface or abstract class that defines a method for cloning the object. Then, create concrete classes that implement the prototype and provide their own implementation of the cloning method.

Prototype pattern is particularly useful when you want to create new objects that are similar to existing ones, but with some modifications. It allows you to avoid the overhead of creating new objects from scratch and can improve the performance of your application.
